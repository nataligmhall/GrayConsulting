# Gray Consulting & Management — Website

This repository contains the source code for the official one-page website of **Gray Consulting & Management**.

The site is intentionally designed as a lightweight, design-forward web presence that communicates company identity and legitimacy through structure, typography, and interaction rather than detailed service descriptions.

---

## Overview

The website is a static, single-page experience built with:

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Vanilla JavaScript  

It is deployed via **GitHub Pages** and optimized for performance, accessibility, and long-term simplicity.

The goal of this project is to maintain a clean, modern digital presence while allowing flexibility as the company evolves across different digital initiatives and product experiments.

### Archive

Older versions of the website are preserved in the `/archive` directory rather than deleted.  
This maintains historical continuity and allows rollback or reference when needed.

Archived files are not part of the live deployment.

## Design Principles

The site follows several core principles:

- Minimal, editorial design
- Strong typography hierarchy
- Lightweight performance
- Responsive across devices
- Subtle motion and scroll-based interaction
- Intentional, high-level messaging

The emphasis is on clarity, credibility, and modern digital presentation.
